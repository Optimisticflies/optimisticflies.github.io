<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>hello! recently, we have heard about a burst in popularity surrounding the link lamerzone.net/karl, which has confused us a lot. in lamerzone, karl is a link that is seen to be private, and is and never was intended for the general public. if you wish to explore the site, i'd advise you start at the root, and look through the site as designed, only using the hyperlinks given to you, and not going searching for random directories. unless, of course, you have been given express permission from the creators of lamerzone, and have been told about the the private links in person, or via email (enquiwies@lamerzone.net). thankyou for your time, and thankyou for using lamerzone.net.</p>
