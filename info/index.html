<h1>SO WTF THIS ACTUALLY IS</h1>
<div>Lamerzone.net is a project made by me - optimistic, or NOOBRR :3 I am doing this to both act as a blog- maybe even post some art later :0 and to also improve my html skills.</div>
<h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
<div>
I am NOOBRR, or Optimistic. i can be found in various places, but i'd rather if random people visiting this site don't just know. if you're from school, half of ts willl confuse you a lot, so... don't bother ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ go back to educational, ig. info about me is that i'm  british, and i'm a minor.</div>
