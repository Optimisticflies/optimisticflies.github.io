<h1>STORY OF LAMERZONE? (idk i've run out of things to put)

<div> so... uhh... when i was probably 12 or something, idk when, i had an epic idea of making a website - i learnt some html when i was eight (the eight key isn't working on this windows 10 library computer), and forgot most of it. however, i never did it, but thought it was kinda cool, and i could even create something like a comments system to chat with people on (how naive i was...). i thought the name "lamezone" was good, since it was kinda grungy, and .net always seemed nice (since who would want a disgusting .com domain). however, almost 4 years later - being 15 now, almost 16 - i have learnt more, and am trying to learn html again. it has also come to my knowledge that "lamezone.net" is in fact cate wurtz's website, and i actually knew who cate wurtz was (without knowing her website), due to listening to twin fantasy, and that lamezone.net is a far better site than this awful pile of spaghetti code (seriously go visit it it's so amazing and lamezine is a great piece of work).... however, yeah. if i can't have lamezone, i will have the lamerzone. i plan to use this to become better at html, javascript and css. i am currently working on making this look actually good, and adding isso comments. after that, when teh site has a genuine basis to it, i am in the process of creating a webcomic, which i may post on here. (it is still very much n the ideas phase, bt i have a few drafts for the storyline, and the working title is "honeycomb"). so... yeah. this also covers why this is called lamerzone....</div>
